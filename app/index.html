  <h2 class="ui header">Dear Food Worth Sharing.</h2>
    <p> In the United States, 40% of food goes to waste and most of it is because of the wrong reasons. And most of this food is perfectly edible but either cosmetically challenged or wrongfully labeled, which makes it impossible to sell.
    Our app will save this food by connecting donors (cafes serving packaged food, and markets), with drivers (volunteers) and receivers (any location that serves food to those in need).
      </p>
      <p> The donors will upload the overload food that they’re unable to sell, which will be immediately available for drivers around to see. 
      Once a driver commits to the food of a specific donor, it has to be picked up within 2 hours.
      Once the food is picked up, the driver has the option to keep it for him/herself or to take it to a receiver.
      In the event the driver keeps the food, nothing will happen.
      In the event the driver delivers the food to a receiver, the mileage traveled will be tracked and stored for reimbursement and/or community service hours or tax credits.

  <h2 class="ui header">FAQ</h2>
    <p>What is CherFood?
CherFood is a platform that connects businesses with surplus food with volunteers to pick it up, and receivers that need it. </p>
      <p>What kind of food can you pick up and deliver?
We can only pick up and deliver packaged foods</p>
        <p>Who pays for this platform and why?
Businesses with surplus food will pay a monthly subscription based on the volume uploaded. This fee is to ensure that the food will be picked up on time with the best quality of service. These businesses will receive tax credits for all the food donated throughout the year, which means there will be more benefits than costs.</p>
            <p>Why volunteer?
The impact you can make as a volunteer is very rewarding. As you volunteer, you will be impacting the life of hundreds of people in need and you will contribute to saving our environment by reducing the waste that goes to landfill. And as a bonus, you may be entitled to mileage reimbursement, tax credits, community service hours, and/or other rewards.
</p>
  <p>Are there any legal issues involving the donation of surplus food?
No! Federal and State laws protect us from civil and criminal liability when sharing surplus food. In 1996, President Clinton signed into law The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act, which states the following:
(c) LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES FROM DONATED FOOD AND GROCERY PRODUCTS.— ‘‘(1) LIABILITY OF PERSON OR GLEANER.—A person or gleaner shall not be subject to civil or criminal liability arising from the nature, age, packaging, or condition of apparently wholesome food or an apparently fit grocery product that the person or gleaner donates in good faith to a nonprofit organization for ultimate distribution to needy individuals.
